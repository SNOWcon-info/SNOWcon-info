### CFP Format
**Title**: The title should be short and relevant. Unfortunately, it's often the only things the attendees will look at to decide if they go see your talk or not. 
**Abstract**: This is the public portion of the submission. It should entice/hype our attendees to go see your talk.  
**Content**: This is the private part of the submission. You explain to our Review Board what your talk is about and how it will be structured in as much details as possible.
